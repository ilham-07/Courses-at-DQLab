# DQLab

DQLab is a very complete data learning portal. If you want to become a data practitioner, then it is mandatory to study at DQLab. There are three programming languages ​​provided, namely R, Python, and SQL. These three languages ​​are very popular in today's data science world.

In DQLab, there is a Learn menu where we can learn material that is presented in a very complete and coherent way, so there is no need to be confused about where to start. Then there are also several projects that are made based on cases in the field, so we can learn and experience firsthand the role of a data practitioner. Do not forget that there is also a Career Track which can be a start for us in starting a career in the data field.

I use this repository to store and share data as a result of studying and working on various materials in DQLab, including:
